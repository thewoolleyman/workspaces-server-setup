# Kubernetes k3s setup

## NOTE

- This doc contains the version of instructions for a "k3s" kubernetes installation.
- It is an alternative approach to the [kubernetes full setup](./kubernetes_full_setup.md), which is documented separately.

# k3s initial tools installation and configuration

- See https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s
- These docs are for k3s v1.32.0+k3s1 (Kubernetes v1.32.0)

# Set up MacOS development machine to administer cluster

## Enable client connection to cluster

- On server, run `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and copy output
- Run remaining commands on dev client machine
- `mkdir -p ~/.kube`
- `vi ~/.kube/config`
- Paste the `admin.config` you copied from the server, if the file is new and empty.
- If the file is not empty (you already have other clusters), paste the following parts (carefully check for correct indentation after pasting, and consider moving `name:` to beginning of array):
    - Paste the `clusters:` entry with `name: default` entry into the `clusters:` array. Change name from `default` to `k3s`
    - Paste the `contexts:` entry with `name: default` entry into the `contexts:` array. Change `cluster` and `name` to `k3s`, and `user` to `k3s-admin`
    - Paste the `users:` entry with `name: default` entry into the `users:` array. Change `name` to `k3s-admin`
- Verify: `kubectl config get-contexts 'k3s'`
```
...
CURRENT   NAME   CLUSTER   AUTHINFO    NAMESPACE
          k3s    k3s       k3s-admin
```
- See current context: `kubectl config current-context`
- If it is different, switch with `kubectx` and pick context `k3s`
