## What is this project?

[Chad's](https://gitlab.com/cwoolley-gitlab) notes and supporting files for setting up [GitLab Remote Development Workspaces](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/) from scratch.

For now, it only contains notes on setting up my home bare-metal server.

## Overview

The approach I am taking is simple and manual. Automation is not a priority for now. For now, the goal is to ensure I document every step in detail for future reference (and potential automation)
