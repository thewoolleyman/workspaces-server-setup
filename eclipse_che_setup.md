# Overview

This doc contains instructions on setting up and using [Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.dev/che/) on the kubernetes cluster.

Che is the primary open-source example of using the [devfile standard](https://devfile.io/) in a Kubernetes environment,
and thus is a good comparison/contrast for the GitLab workspaces offering which also uses the devfile standard.

See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/512722) for more context and background on the motivation
for comparison.
